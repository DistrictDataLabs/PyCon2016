## Description

_If your talk is accepted this will be made public and printed in the program. Should be one paragraph, maximum 400 characters._

Web applications are becoming smarter and more personalized through the clever use of automatic optimization and machine learning algorithms. We present a standard architecture for Django web apps that utilize models trained via Scikit-Learn to tune experiences for specific users. By utilizing familiar tools, this architecture allows for reinforcing models that integrate directly with web apps.

## Detailed Abstract

_Detailed description. Will be made public if your talk is accepted._

Web applications are becoming smarter and more personalized through the clever use of automatic optimization and machine learning algorithms. In this poster, we present a standard architecture for Django web applications that utilizes models trained via Scikit-Learn to predict and tune experiences for specific users. Web application developers will discover that the tools they currently use like Django, REST Frameworks, and PostgreSQL are also the framework required for online machine learning. Data scientists will discover that a web platform is ideal for reinforcing models through feedback, employing ensemble techniques, and deciding when to retrain models.   

Machine learning algorithms differ from traditional data mining in that they utilize pattern recognition techniques from historical data to learn how to identify or predict outcomes for new information. As the algorithm makes predictions, feedback is utilized to adapt or correct the model so that it learns from new experience as well as the old. This makes web and mobile applications an ideal place to employ or deploy machine learned models. As users interact with your application, they train models that can then be used to tune the experience for new users or to personalize content for existing users.

Machine learning methods have two phases: a training/validation phase and an operational phase. For this reason, traditional web architectures that employ an application server and backend database need to be adapted to fit into the ML lifecycle. In this poster we present a machine learning architecture for directly using models inside of web applications, particularly via a RESTful API.

## Additional Notes

_Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc._

The authors have a lot of experience utilizing Django apps to produce Machine Learning architectures -- in fact it was the repetitious development of these applications that caused them to formulate a standard architecture for machine learning on the web! They teach at District Data Labs - a data science education company in Washington DC that focuses on building data products with Python. They are also part of Data Community DC - a not-for-profit organization of 6 meetups that organizes monthly events for the DC2 community. The authors have spoken at Strata, are O'Reilly and Packt authors, and are keen to see web developers integrate more machine learning into their apps and to have data scientists not be afraid to throw together Django applications!

## Additional Requirements

_Please let us know if you have any specific needs (A/V requirements, multiple microphones, a table, etc). Note for example that 'audio out' is not provided for your computer unless you tell us in advance._

It would be nice if we could have a screen with an HDMI hookup to demo the architecture next to the poster, but not necessary. We could provide an example web app that uses a classifier to tune an experience. However we can also simply put a link to a responsive app so that poster viewers can try it out on their mobile devices.

The poster will have lots of visual elements and will be printed on a glossy 40" x 30". We would need to know ahead of time if we should mount it on form board (therefore an easel will be required) or if there is a non-destructive way of mounting the poster.
